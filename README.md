# USIU-Grade-management-system
 A mobile application meant to help USIU students and lecturers in Grade management.
 The application allows users to log in first.
 Upon logging in, the system determines the user's role i.e whether the user is an admin, a lecturer or a student.
 Each user has a different home page that they land on once logged in.
 Each user also has different activities to perform.
 The main activity for students is viewing their grades from different courses.
 The main activities for lecturers are grading students, updating the grade records as well as deleting them and viewing the grades given.
 The main activities for admins are to create, update or delete user records.
